# Challenge yourself

Implement the delete pages for the `Book`, `BookInstance`, and `Genre` models, linking them from the associated detail pages in the same way as our Author delete page. The pages should follow the same design approach:

- If there are references to the object from other objects, then these other objects should be displayed along with a note that this record can't be deleted until the listed objects have been deleted.
- If there are no other references to the object then the view should prompt to delete it. If the user presses the Delete button, the record should then be deleted.

A few tips:

- Deleting a `Genre` is just like deleting an `Author`, as both objects are dependencies of `Book` (so in both cases you can delete the object only when the associated books are deleted).
- Deleting a `Book` is also similar as you need to first check that there are no associated `BookInstances`.
- Deleting a `BookInstance` is the easiest of all because there are no dependent objects. In this case, you can just find the associated record and delete it.

Implement the update pages for the `BookInstance`, `Author`, and `Genre` models, linking them from the associated detail pages in the same way as our Book update page.

A few tips:

- The Book update page we just implemented is the hardest! The same patterns can be used for the update pages for the other objects.
- The `Author` date of death and date of birth fields and the `BookInstance` due_date field are the wrong format to input into the date input field on the form (it requires data in form "YYYY-MM-DD"). The easiest way to get around this is to define a new virtual property for the dates that formats the dates appropriately, and then use this field in the associated view templates.
- If you get stuck, there are examples of the update pages in [the example here](https://github.com/mdn/express-locallibrary-tutorial).
